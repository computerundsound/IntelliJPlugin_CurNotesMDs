# CurNotesMDs - IntelliJ - Plugin

IntelliJ (and all intellj based IDEs) from 
jetbrains can use plugins to expand the range of functions.

This is a Plugin for all intellj-based IDEs.

## What can I do with this ?

With this plugin, you can save some notes to your project on an very easy way.

It's markdown-format - so you can ease format your notes. 

The notes will be stored in .idea folder - so normally they will not be 
tracked by a version system (like git), if you exclude your .idea -folder from git.

If you **want** to be your notes to be tracked by git, you can add this line into your .gitignore file:

!.idea/.curNotes.md

The plugin requires the MarkDownSupport Plugin 

If you don't want to changes in markdown-format, you can use the Plugion

CurNotes instead of this (CurNotesMDs).
